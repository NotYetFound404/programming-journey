# Programming Journey

## Welcome to my Programming Journey repository! 🚀

This is where I store all the code snippets, experiments, and random ideas I come up with as I explore different programming languages, frameworks, and concepts. Each folder represents a different day, language or category, making it easy to track my progress over time.
This repository will also serve as a companion to the content on my website, where I document my learning journey in more detail.

# Today's Snippet:

I wrote a cointegration-based pairs trading strategy in R with a backtest using synthetic data!
Started a mbs pricing project with synth data
